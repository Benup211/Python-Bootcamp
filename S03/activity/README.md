<h1>Leap Year and Grade Assign</h1>
<p>
The provided code contains two functions: <strong>leap_year_checker()</strong> and <strong>grade_classifier().</strong>

The <i>leap_year_checker()</i> function prompts the user to enter a year, checks if it is a leap year, and returns a Boolean value indicating whether it is a leap year or not. The function follows the logic that a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.

The <i>grade_classifier()</i> function prompts the user to enter a numerical score, assigns a letter grade based on the score, and returns the assigned grade. The function follows the logic that a score of 90 or above is assigned the grade "S", a score between 75 and 89 (inclusive) is assigned the grade "P", and any other score is assigned the grade "F".
